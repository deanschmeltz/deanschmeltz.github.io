## welcome to my personal website

There's not much here right now, but I'm not about to let some other "Dean Schmeltz" claim this domain name. Not on my watch.

### about me

I was born in Elgin, IL in 1991. I received my B.A. in Linguistics from Reed College in 2014, and I am currently pursuing an M.S.Ed. in Intercultural Communication from the University of Pennsylvania (anticipated May 2018). 

### what I'm up to

Here I'll be posting links to some things I've been reading or writing, so stay tuned. Just for kicks, here's my undergrad [thesis](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21727847/Dean%20Schmeltz%20Senior%20Thesis.pdf).

### find me elsewhere

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanschmeltz) if you're into that sort of thing.
