#### “The science of language” struck eighteen-year-old me as an appealing contradiction. 

--- 

I put down the course catalogue, un-undecided. Linguistics gave me my first good look at language diversity. I needed that. But studying capital-L Language didn’t give me two little-l languages to rub together. It’s fine – that wasn’t what I wanted. Still isn’t, though saying so bothers me more now.
